## Creating new cops
There are some steps you have to follow when you add new cops:
* Add an entry to `config/default.yml`. It's ordered list, make sure to follow the order.
* The description of the cop in the code should match the one in config. `bin/build_config` takes care of this.
* The cop should include examples of good and bad code.
* Add tests for as much use cases as you can think of. Always add tests for both code that should be reported and good code that should pass.
* Some common pitfalls:
** If you are writing cop inspecting code outside of an example, check for false positive when similarly named variables are used inside of the example.
** If your cop is inspecting code inside an example, check that it works when the example is empty (empty `describe`, `it`, etc.).
